# Hi there, I'm Gabriel Sassaki (toshiye) 👋

### Software Engineer | TypeScript & Node.js Specialist | Creative Writer

I am a passionate developer focused on building scalable, event-driven architectures and exploring the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Engineering**. With a strong foundation in the **JavaScript/TypeScript** ecosystem, I bridge the gap between complex backend logic and creative storytelling.

## ✍️ Beyond the Code

When I'm not debugging PostgreSQL queries or tuning neural networks, I'm building worlds. I am a **Creative Writer** currently developing a post-apocalyptic e-book. 

I believe that **great code and great writing share the same DNA**: clarity, structure, and the ability to solve complex problems through logic and imagination.
